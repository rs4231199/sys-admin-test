Q1.
First I created an aws account. And then I followed the [streisand installation guide](https://github.com/StreisandEffect/streisand/blob/master/Installation.md). I was using ubuntu 20.04 and it didn't work. So I created a virtual machine(ubuntu 16.04) on Amazon Lightsail. It gave some errors at first but I solved them with the help of [this](https://github.com/StreisandEffect/streisand/issues/1801#issuecomment-682227666).
I learned that for one time use remote virtual machines are the best because It doesn't disturb your current workflow and you can deal with big size data on the mobile data.


Q2.
Since 'b' was a test project, I can safely delete the `user69`.
